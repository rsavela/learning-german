Resources for learning the German Language

Russ Savela, 2024

This is a collection of resources for learning German.  I started studying German in the fall
of 2022.  It is partially inspired by XXX guide to learning French that I came across in the 
1990s.


## Duolingo

Like lots of people, I used this.  I finished the German tree in Decembrer 2024.  It helps
with vocabulary, but not much at all with speaking and grammar.  But it free, and you will
probably do it every day.

## Lingoda

This is what I started with.  Still using it, on A2 lessons right now.  If you aren't in
a German speaking country, probably the best option.  I like the lesson plans.

## Books

A few so far.

## Exercises

TBD.

## Media - movies and TV

Netflix, etc.

## Language Classes - In Person

TBD, looking at schools in Berlin
